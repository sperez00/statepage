                In other countries cute stuff is considered to be for children and isn't seen outside toy stores.
                In Japan cute, or kawaii is everywhere! At stations, shopping malls, billboards you will always 
                discover Hello Kitty or what about a whole train in Pokemon style? Japanese people love to use
                mascots to promote anything. Cuteness can really brighten up your mood!

                    Japanese people love shopping! Tokyo has many famous chain shops that most countries have like
                     H&M and Zara but they also have tiny boutiques and their own chain stores.
                      Every place you will visit in Tokyo will have their own unique shops so you will never be bored!
